# autostars.de - On Board Diagnosis SDK

## What is the OBD cloud
autostars.de offers an reactive obd sensor cloud which can be used for Car2X integration in your business workflow.
It provides sensor information from your car and fuses sensor information from the mobile device to a session based 
reactive stream and provides this information to multiple connected clients.

All you need to obtain to run vehicle diagnostic and fusion of mobile device sensors or build your own use case is 
to have a Bluetooth 4.0 BLE obd dongle and an authorization-key for your requests against the cloud. Use this SDK 
to integrate easily with your mobile application and be able to to fully run diagnostic of your car in the web.

## Architectural overview
The following section descriptes the real time streaming flow from your car to the cloud infrastructure. 
As shown in the this figure the SDK enables a obd session between the car and cloud. This session consists
of an idenfifier and pincode to secure the flow from third parties.

The remote client (needs session pincode to access) or the mobile device itself can than send ObdCommands to 
the infrastructure for their session. After the cloud has used the real time channel to the car and evaluated the
protocol an corresponding ObdEvent is emitted and can be consumed via SSE by multiple connected remote clients.

## Requirements

1. Please get in touch at essbach@imoveit.de to get authorization.

2. Get a aupported Bluetooth 4.0 BLE OBD dongle with ELM327 chipset: 

  * [Vgate iCar Pro Bluetooth 4.0](https://www.amazon.de/Vgate-Bluetooth-Fehler-Code-Leser-Adapter/dp/B071D8SYXN)

## Demo

See the following Youtube Video for further real time demonstration of the flow:

## Application Interface

You submit so called `OBDCommands` such as `ReadVinNumber` or `DeleteErrorCodes` at the endpoint

`https://obd.autostars.de/obd/execute`

Currently available commands are automatically published at `https://obd.autostars.de/obd/commands`

```
{
  "commands" : [ "ReadErrorCodes", "DeleteErrorCodes", "ReadConsumptionRate", "ReadRpmNumber", "ReadVinNumber", "ReadBatteryVoltage" ]
}
```

You will receive so called `ObdEvents` within your session stream via the Server Sent Events (SSE) at:

`https://obd.autostars.de/obd/stream`

Currently available events are automatically published via the OpenAPI 3.0 Spec here:  `https://obd.autostars.de/internal/swagger.json`

Example of one Event could be:

```
"BatteryVoltageRead" : {
  "type" : "object",
  "required" : [ "voltage" ],
  "properties" : {
    "voltage" : {
      "type" : "string"
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation

Add this SDK `ASIOSObdSdk` to your `Podfile` of your own project and run `pod install`.

Example:
```
platform :ios, '13.0'

target 'YourProject' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'ASIOSObdSdk', '~> 1.0.0'
end
```

After this done add this parameters to your `Info.plist` file to access `BLE devices` within the iOS Framework of apple.

* `Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description`
* `Privacy - Bluetooth Peripheral Usage Description`

For `GPS Location` purposes activate

* `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`
* `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist`.
 
 ## Usage of the SDK
 
 For full example please refer to the Example Application which represents an intelligent milage tracker with real time fuel consumption.
 
 Initialize the SDK using the following code and supply the corresponding eventhandler implementations.
 
```
self.cloud = ApiManager
           .init(options: ApiOptions.init(onConnected: self.onConnected,
                                          onDisconnected: self.onDisconnected,
                                          onBackendEvent: self.onBackendEvent,
                                          onAvailableCommands: self.onAvailableCommands)
           )
           .connect(token: "authorization-token-here")
```

## Example Application

 * Intelligent logbook real time consumption, location and live fuel pricing data
